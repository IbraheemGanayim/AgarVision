# AgarVision

Welcome to AgarVision, a cutting-edge mobile application specifically designed to revolutionize the way researchers count bacterial colonies on agar plates. By automating this crucial process, AgarVision significantly enhances accuracy and efficiency in biotechnological research environments.

## Elevating Research with AgarVision
AgarVision was crafted during Phase B of our capstone project, employing advanced technologies such as OpenCV for real-time image segmentation, and K-means clustering to manage variations in texture and color, even with limited datasets. Our goal is to mitigate human error in manual counts and streamline research workflows.

## Core Features
- **Advanced Image Segmentation**: Leverages OpenCV's adaptive thresholding techniques for precise image segmentation.
- **Accurate Colony Detection**: Utilizes custom-developed contour detection algorithms to pinpoint and delineate bacterial colonies with remarkable accuracy.
- **Sophisticated Clustering**: Applies K-means clustering to address textural and color inconsistencies, ensuring minimal data does not compromise result accuracy.
- **Enhanced Security**: Features top-tier security protocols including data encryption and user token authentication to safeguard sensitive information.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Employs Firebase for robust cloud storage solutions, complete with regular backups for unparalleled data integrity and reliability.
